PROJECT 1: SHELL

COMMENTS:

When piping, the first command executes, but the second does not. I was 
not able to determine why this is.

COMMANDS:

exit - exits the shell (also accepts x)
cd <path> - changes the working directory to the location specified.
	Accepts absolute AND relative paths, as well as .. and ., but
	does not accept ~.
echo <argument> | <$environment variable> - prints out argument or the 
	value assigned to the environment variable specified
viewproc <file name> - prints out contents of filename specified if the 
	file can be found in /proc/
time <command> - executes the command as normal, then prints out the
	time elapsed in execution. Execution of time command does not 
	depend on the contents of the command or any modifiers on the 
	command, allowing for full versatility.
<non-built-in> - executes the file name specified. Accepts absolute 
	paths and relative paths if the path indicated is within the 
	system path. Please do not execute in the form of ./<filename>, 
	as the current working directory is considered part of the 
	system path. ./<filename> is accepted, but it is unnecesary.
	Also, emacs, vim, pico/nano, and man all work on this shell.
	Furthermore, this shell is capable of opening itself, performing 
	make on its own source code, and editting its own source code in 
	nano/pico/vim/emacs.

MODIFIERS:

<non-built-in> & - executes a non-built-in in the background. 
<non-built-in> < <file name> - redirects the input of an execution from 
	stdin to a specified file name
<non-built-in> > <file name> - redirects the output of an execution from 
	stdout to a specified file name
<non-built-in> | <non-built-in> - pipes the output of the first command 
	to the input of the second command (THIS FEATURE IS BUGGY)
